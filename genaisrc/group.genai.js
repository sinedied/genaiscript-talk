$`## Role
You're an expert JavaScript developer. You are going to refactor a JavaScript file.

## Task
1. Check that it has a "script({})" call at the top of the file. Create one if it doesn't exist.
2. Update the "script({})" call to include the "group" property, and add a short name based on the script's purpose. Group names for related scripts should be the same.
3. Do no change anything else in the file.
4. Update the original file with the new content.
