## Abstract

**Prompting is the New Scripting: Meet GenAIScript**

jQuery once made web development easier by abstracting away complexities, allowing developers to focus on building rather than battling browser quirks. Today, AI development faces a similar challenge. New patterns emerge constantly and keeping up can be overwhelming, especially as AI tools become more powerful and complex. What if you could leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities to automate tasks using simple, familiar JavaScript abstractions? Enter GenAIScriptâ€”a way to integrate AI into your workflow effortlessly, treating prompts like reusable code snippets. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore how GenAIScript makes AI automation feel as intuitive as writing JavaScript, helping you streamline repetitive work without the need for deep AI expertise.
-->

```js
$('#hello').text('dotJS');
```

<!-- 
jQuery once simplified web development by abstracting away complexities â€” and I think AI needs the same today.

Nearly 20 years ago, jQuery changed the way we build web applications. It made it easier to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and create animations, when browsers at the time were full of quirks. It was a game-changer, allowing developers like you and me to focus on what we wanted to achieve. 

Today, we face a similar challenge with GenAI. Every week we have new models, new tools, new approaches, and trying to get productive with GenAI while keeping up with all the changes can be exhausting.

And you'll see that it's way more than just a fancy wrapper for prompts.

Or looking through all the changes in a PR trying to figure out what was the intent behind the changes - takes time. And it's not the really the fun part of OSS to be honest.

And since I've been working with GenAI for a while now, I thought that it could actually be useful for use cases like this, if I could make it work without too much effort!

That's how I started looking into GenAIScript.

- Use with CLI, VS Code or GitHub Copilot
- Works with GitHub Models, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama...
- Built-in prompts, tools, agents and helpers

<!--
GenAIScript is a Open Source JS toolbox for GenAI, allowing you to create even agents to do complex tasks for you, as simple as writing a script. 

It's really meant to be a developer tool and works best when it's used within a project repository.

But really instead of telling you about its extensive set of features, let's see it in action.

## Issue reviewer: 6min
- Open `issue-review.genai.js`
  * Here I've created a new GenAIScript.
  * The first thing you may have noticed is this `.genai.js` extension:
  * This is what enables the GenAIScript environment. It works with TS and you can use ES Modules.
  * Now let's start with the prompt: I want to build a script that will help me review issues.
  * `issue_prompt` explain the prompt
  * `issue_def` to define the title/body
  * Here comes usually the difficult part: how to give the AI model the proper context so that it can do its job?
  * `issue_github` to get the issue
  * `issue_script` to set the meta

- Explain how to run or debug the script, then run the script

- Now, I want this script to run on my GH repo, so I created a GH Action.
  * I won't dive too much into the details, but the important parts here are:
    - The action is triggered on issue events
    - It runs the script using `npx` and the genaiscript CLI
    - It uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and the permissions to create a comment
  * Open the issue in the repo and show the results

- Run the script
  * Show the extension panel
  * Add title/description meta
  * Change the model to "ollama:phi4"

## Copilot: Gen background: 4min
- Open `background.genai.js`
  * Now let's do something a bit different: when I work on a talk, I'm always looking for nice backgrounds for my slides. So I wanted to see if could use a script for that.
  * `bg_prompt` explain the prompt
  * `bg_def` to define the question
  * `bg_tool` to define the tool => tool+prompt=agent
  * `bg_script` to set the meta

- @genaiscript /run background geometric gradients blue

## Agent: Git changelog generator: 4min
- Open `changelog.genai.js`
  * `ch_prompt` explain the prompt
  * `ch_def_agent` explain agent

# Syntax recap

```ts
// Prompt templates
$`Say hello to ${name}`

// Set context
def(README, 'README.md')
defImage(PICTURE, 'https://http.cat/403')

// Create tools
defTool(
  'random',
  'Generate a random number',
  async () => Math.random(),
)

// Create agents
defAgent(
  'math',
  'Agent that does math operations',
  `You're a math expert. Answer the question using provided tools.`,
  { system: 'python', tools: ['random'] },
)
```

<div class="text-center font-size-9">

<v-after>

```js
$`Refactor all components to use the new
template syntax introduced in Angular 17`

// Built-in: ast-grep, fs, agent_fs...
```

</v-after>

<!-- 
You might still wonder how far this can be useful in your projects.

[click] Then what about automated refactoring of your code?
For example, Angular introduced a new template syntax, it can be a pain to update all your components manually, or write a proper migration script to do it.

GenAIScript provides built-in support for navigating the file system, and even for AST manipulation, so hard scripts like this can become easier to write as a prompt.

There's way more to GenAIScript that what I can show you in 20min, and if there's a fancy new AI tool or pattern that you've heard about, there are good chances that GenAIScript already has it or will have it soon.

But to my regret there's still one thing that you have to keep in mind...

<!-- 
Right now, it's build as tool for you to use rather than a framework to build applications. 

[click] Though I should note that it can run as an MCP server, exposing your scripts as tools to be used by your regular GenAI apps and workflows. If you've never heard of MCP, it's an open protocol that allows you to expose your GenAI tools and resources for models to use.

Now what I hope is that we'll get GenAI frameworks in the future that gets inspired by the simplicity of GenAIScript.
